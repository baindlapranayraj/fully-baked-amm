# AMM(Automated Market Maker)

## Overview
This is a fully backed Automated Market Maker (AMM) built using the Anchor framework on Solana.
An AMM is a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) used in cryptocurrency trading. Instead of using a traditional order book (where buyers and sellers are matched), AMMs use algorithms to automatically set prices based on the supply and demand of assets in a liquidity pool.

## Features:

**Constant Product AMM:** Supports trading of two tokens with a constant product formula.
**Multiple Pools:** Admin can create multiple pools for users to swap or deposit their tokens.
**Token Swapping:** Users can swap tokens within the AMM.
**Adding Liquidity:** Users can add liquidity to pools, which is crucial for maintaining the AMM's functionality.
**Minting Liquidity Pool Tokens:** After adding liquidity, users receive LP tokens.
**Removing Liquidity:** Users can remove or withdraw assets from liquidity pools.
